REST: 

1. Separate API into logical resource
- tours users reviews 

2. Expose structured resource-based URLs
- https://www.natours.com/addNewTour
- addNewTour is the end point 

3. Use HTTP methods
- /getTour is bad =>  identify *GET* request /tours/7
- /addATour => *POST*
- /updateTour => *PUT* *PATCH*
- /deleteTour => *DELETE*

4. Send data as JSON

5. Be stateless
All state is handles on the client not the server. 
- Each request must contain al the information necessary to process a certain request. 
- The server doesnt need to remember preious requests.

currentPage = 5 => move to 6
